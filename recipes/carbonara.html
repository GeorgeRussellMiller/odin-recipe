<h3>Description</h3>
<p>a dish of hot pasta into which other ingredients (such as eggs, bacon or ham, and grated cheese) have been mixed â€”often used as a postpositive modifier spaghetti carbonara.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
    <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
    <li>5 slices bacon</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package creame cheese</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, adding peas in the last minute of cooking. Drain and keep warm in a bowl.</li>

    <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to paper towels, reserving 1 tablespoon of drippings in the skillet.</li>

    <li>Add garlic to the skillet; saute for 1 minute. Reduce heat to low and stir in milk and cream cheese until blended.</li>

    <li>Crumble bacon and add to the linguine along with sauce and Parmesan cheese; stir to coat.</li>
